Pass Down Search Result and Render Result List
29.
In this assessment, you will pass the state of a search results parameter through a series of components to render an array of tracks.

When a user requests data from Spotify, the JSON response will include a set of song tracks. Each track will contain a field for name, artist, and album. For each track in the results list, your Jammming web app will display the song name, artist, and album.

In a later assessment, you will build a method that sets the state of the search results parameter to a response from the Spotify API.

30.
Add a constructor function to the App component, and pull in props from the React.Component class.

Inside of the App component in App.js, create a constructor method.

Pass props to the constructor function and use super() to call the parent constructor.

31.
Inside of the App component, set a hard-coded initial value for this.state.searchResults.

Inside of the App constructor, set this.state to an object with a property called searchResults set to an array of objects, each containing name, artist, album, and id properties.

32.
Pass the state of the App component's searchResults to the SearchResults component.

Pass this.state.searchResults to the SearchResults component as an attribute called searchResults.

33.
Pass the search results from the SearchResults component to the TrackList component.

Inside the SearchResults.js .render() method, pass this.props.searchResults as an attribute called tracks in the TrackList component.

34.
In the TrackList component, use the .map() method to render each track in the tracks property.

Set the key attribute to track.id.

Inside the TrackList component's render method, use .map() on this.props.tracks to render each track in the list.

This will require you to pass the current track as an attribute called track to the Track component.

35.
Render the track name, artist, and album.

Use the following property calls to access the track's name, artist, and album:

this.props.track.name
this.props.track.artist
this.props.track.album
